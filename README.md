## Prerequisites

### Required Software
1. **Python (3.7 or higher):**
   - Install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).
   - Ensure `python` and `pip` are in your system's PATH.

   Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python --version
   pip --version
   ```

2. **Virtual Environment (Optional):**
   - Use `venv` or `conda` to manage dependencies.

   Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Deep Learning Libraries:**
   Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If `requirements.txt` is unavailable, manually install PyTorch and TensorFlow:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision tensorflow numpy matplotlib
   ```
